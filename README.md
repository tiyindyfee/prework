# Front End Engineer Prework

Welcome! Are you ready to get started? Prework is material that ensures you have the basic foundation required for the course. Starting your learning journey before the class is like training for a marathon. You don't show up the day of the race without preparation, you need to train beforehand. In our classes, your brain is the muscle that needs to be trained. This prework is training for your brain.



## Online Accounts & Mac Familiarity

**Please sign up for these online accounts before starting:**
- [CodePen](http://codepen.io/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) and complete your profile
- [Medium](https://medium.com/) and make an initial blog post about the start of your journey
- [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/)

You may want to use a password manager like [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) (free!) to help you keep track of logins, and automatically log you into accounts.

There is no paid software required for the class. We will install a number of tools to be used, such as a code editor (Atom.io), but they will all be free and/or open source. If you're new to a Mac (or old, even), check out https://www.apple.com/support/macbasics.



## Begin Your Brain Training

Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)

Compose an email to your instructor answering the following questions:

1. Which type of mindset (growth or fixed) do you think you are most strongly associated with? Why?
2. What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

## Begin Your Developer Training

Start these and finish as much of these as possible:

**Learn to use the terminal (estimated time, 4 hours)**
The command line is an interface to the internals of your computer, as opposed to the graphical user interface (GUI) that we commonly use. We will be using the command line in our class, but the point of this prework is not to be an expert, just to start to get comfortable.

Read the following article and complete the course on Treehouse (_Note: Treehouse has free 7-day trials. Just use a trial. But make sure you have time to do the material in those seven days._)

- http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console

**Learn some basic HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (estimated time, 8-16 hours)**

- https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming

**Start learning Git (estimated time, 4 hours)**

- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control
- https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

Spend about 1-2 hours each day on the courses to round out any foundational knowledge necessary to start the class.


## Beyond The Basics

If you're ready for more advanced stuff, here's some **bonus** material:

- Read "[Principles Of Effective Web Design By Vitaly Friedman](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/)".
- Read "[Dieter Rams: Ten Principles For Good Design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design)".
- Read through [LearnLayout.com](http://learnlayout.com/).
- Watch the [AtoZ CSS Videos](http://www.atozcss.com/start-here/).
- Rocked the other stuff and still hungry for more? Have a read through [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).
